<h1>Usability Report</h1>
<h2>By: Erika, Mubashir, Ahmad</h2>

<h3>General Critique</h3>
<p>Individuals that tested our application agreed that it is fairly straight forward and easy to use,
it gives them a sense of credibility that an online based store should give them. Although almost
all users hated the prices that were stated for each item because they were too high. The general
layout of the site was also despised by participants. Another problem was, it was difficult for the
user to identify the navigation link to the home page from product page. Text size on the home page
is another problem, heading text for "featured products" and "new products" had poor visibility.
There is no message when products are added to the cart, thus it seems nothing is added and makes
user confused.

<h3>Usability Testing Round One</h3>
<p>From Round One of testing, we learned that we had quite some issues that needed to be fixed. From
the mobile aspect, there were some major issues, some of which were issues to the website as a whole.
One of the said issues was that the images on our site were not working properly. This was a
relatively easy fix along with spelling errors. Another issue that was discovered was that buttons
were not working correctly. If I recall correctly, this was due to our paths not being the same, we
had done some re-naming so I think we forgot to fix the paths. The user testing on mobile also indicated
that the website was not clear enough, as at some moments they were left pensive and confused. When
the user got to the checkout process, through the click of the "Buy Now" button, the website went
straight to the Shipping Method page and skipped the Contact and Shipping form/page. What was also
later noticed was that the user was almost expecting some sort of confirmation that they had completed
the process. I recall that the mobile user was left wondering if something else would happen.</p>

<p>From mobile testing changes made was to fix the issues with the buttons, fix the images, and
added a confirmation page at the end of the process. The aim of the page was to let the users know
that they had placed their order.</p>

<h3>Usability Testing Round Two</h3>
<p>Round Two of testing seemed to have gone better than the first round. The changes made after round
one seemed to have worked. The user testing on mobile found that he was making lots of assumptions.
For example, on the Products page, there were indeed products but when he would click on them he made
the assumption that they went to a cart. There was no clear indication of this other than a highlight on the
border. He also mentioned that he saw a "trash image" which he assumed to be for removing the product
from the cart. The user then went on to fill the form and he said that the information overlapped,
the field text would overlap with the text input making it illegible.

<p>Previously learned content was that we should not leave the user any room for assumptions. The user
should be able to figure out what is going on fairly quickly. The issues that we found did not do
this, this alone puts us at a great disadvantage because if this were a deployed actual site the user
would very likely leave our site if they could not figure out what was going on.</p>
